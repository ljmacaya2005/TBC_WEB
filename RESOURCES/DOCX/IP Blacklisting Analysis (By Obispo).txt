RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS: TERMINATION AND BLACKLISTING VIA IP ADDRESS
Context: HTML Project with Domain Hosting

================================================================================
PART 1: NETWORK AND SERVER LEVEL (Basic Blocking)
================================================================================

1. ROUTER LEVEL BLOCKING
To block IPs at the hardware entry point:
   - Log in to your router’s admin panel.
   - Navigate to the security settings. This section might be labeled as Firewall, Security, Access Control, or Internet Filtering depending on the firmware.
   - Locate the option to restrict or block IP addresses.
   - Enter the specific IP addresses you wish to blacklist and save the changes.

2. WINDOWS FIREWALL BLOCKING (Server/Local Machine)
Blocking IPs on a Windows environment requires configuring the Windows Firewall. A firewall allows your computer to block access to your network without inhibiting your ability to communicate with outside networks.

   Step A: Identify the Target IP
   - Open your internet browser and locate the website or user you want to block.
   - Open Command Prompt (Admin) from the Start menu.
   - (Note: You typically use the "ping" or "nslookup" command here to convert a domain name into an IP address).

   Step B: Configure the Block
   - Use the Windows Firewall "Inbound Rules" to create a new rule.
   - Select "Custom" rule, apply it to "All Programs," and specify the IP addresses found in Step A under the "Remote IP addresses" section.
   - Select "Block the connection."

PART 2: WEB APPLICATION & HOSTING LEVEL (Recommended for Domain Hosting)
================================================================================

For a hosted web project, relying on routers or local firewalls is often insufficient. The following strategies are industry standards for web security:

1. IMPLEMENT A CDN/WAF (e.g., Cloudflare)
   Putting your site behind a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or Web Application Firewall (WAF) is the most effective method.
   - Enable Rate Limiting: Restrict the number of requests a user can make in a specific timeframe.
   - Bot Protection: Automatically challenge or block automated scripts.
   - Auto-block Bad IPs: Stops most known attacks before they even reach your server.

2. APPLICATION-LEVEL RATE LIMITING
   Code logic within your application to handle traffic spikes:
   - Limit requests per IP (e.g., 100 requests per minute).
   - Trigger temporary IP bans when these limits are exceeded.

3. BLOCK UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS
   - Protect admin and private routes with strong authentication.
   - Auto-block IPs that repeatedly hit protected routes (brute force attempts) or fail authentication multiple times.

4. TEMPORARY VS. PERMANENT BLOCKS
   - Use temporary blocks (e.g., 1 hour or 24 hours) rather than permanent bans.
   - This prevents "false positives" (accidentally blocking legitimate users) and handles dynamic IPs better.

5. LOGGING AND MONITORING
   - Log every blocked attempt including the IP, the route requested, and the reason for the block.
   - Review these logs to tune your security rules and avoid over-blocking.
